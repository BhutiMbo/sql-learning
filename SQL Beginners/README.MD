## ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here

- SQL scripts and exercises I've completed
- Notes and examples from tutorials and courses
- Real-world practice queries using sample datasets

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `student_queries.sql` â€“ My saved SQL document with practice queries and examples
- `README.md` â€“ This file, explaining the purpose and contents of the repository

## ðŸš€ Skills I'm Building

- Writing basic and advanced SQL queries
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data
- Joining tables and working with subqueries
- Understanding relational database concepts

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master SQL syntax and logic
- Prepare for real-world data analysis tasks
- Build a strong foundation for future work with databases and data science

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

Feel free to explore the `.sql` file to see the types of queries I'm working on. If you're learning SQL too, clone the repo and try running the queries on your own database setup!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BhutiMbo/sql-learning.git
